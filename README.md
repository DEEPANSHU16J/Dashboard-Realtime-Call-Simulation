# Dashboard-Realtime-Call-Simulation
Created a Dashboard to simulate the  real-time performance monitoring for a call center using Python, Microsoft SQL Server, and Power BI, which allows to visualize and analyze crucial call center metrics on-the-fly. The dashboard will provide real-time insights into call volume, agent performance, customer satisfaction, and other essential KPIs. This enables call center managers and supervisors to make data-driven decisions promptly, improving overall efficiency and customer experience.

The components required for this project are as follows:

Python: Use Python for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL(Extract, Tranform, Load) processes. Python can connect to the call center's database in Microsoft SQL Server to fetch real-time data.

Microsoft SQL Server: Set up a database to store call center data. The database will receive data from call center systems, such as call logs, agent performance metrics, and customer feedback.

Power BI: Create interactive and visually appealing dashboards using Power BI. It allows you to connect to the Microsoft SQL Server database to fetch real-time data and visualize it in various chart types like bar graphs, line charts, and gauges.
